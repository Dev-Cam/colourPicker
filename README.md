# colourPicker
A colour picking game to help learn RGB colours
Tech: Html, CSS, JavaScript

## The what and how
This is the first ever project I made when began my career change journey from cheffing to developing. 
It is a simple game where you select the tile you think is the RGB colour displayed at the top.

There are two levels of difficulty which you can change at any time.
When you win you can simply click play again.

## Learning
It can not be understated how much this taught me, from basic HTML layouts to styling with vanilla CSS to functionality with JavaScript

Go ahead and clone it down and have a play.

Although some of the code is out of date and definitely not the best practice I have decided to leave it to serve as a reminder of where I started.
